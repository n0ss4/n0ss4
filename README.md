# üí´ About Me:
Programming has been my passion since childhood. My curiosity to understand how various applications and games were created propelled me on this path. Over the years, I've honed my skills in a broad spectrum of technologies and programming languages.

Learning and expanding my knowledge have always been my driving motivations. I started as a self-taught enthusiast, eagerly absorbing books and tutorials. Later, I formalized my education with a diploma in Microcomputer Systems and Networks, followed by advanced studies in Web Applications Development. Proudly, I can now say that I have recently completed my degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Girona (UdG).

In my free time, I love to bring my own projects and ideas to fruition. I constantly strive to stay informed and adapt to evolving platforms and new programming languages. This continuous learning and experimentation is not just a hobby but a reflection of my dedication to the field of computing.
